\section{Methods}
Because we both initially thought that this lab seemed to be quite simple, we ended up doing two separate approaches and then looking at the other persons ideas.
This was then merged into a final solution.
After that we made some bugfixes and some extra functionality, such as motion blur in the star field.

We tried to make the solutions as elegant as possible.
Both of us have taken the C++ course (DD2387), so we are quite comfortable from using C++ components such as templates, iterators and new features from C++11.

When we started merging our projects, we chose to start using some proper version tracking with git. This helper our work substantially, and was something that carried on to the other labs.
